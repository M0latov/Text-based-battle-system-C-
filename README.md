# Text based battle-system in C++
A small but humourus text based battle system made in C++, using the C standard library, in addition to some other libraries such as <vector>.

To make the player and enemy classes i used inheretence, meaning that both classes inherited from a base class; each class also has their own namespace.

i also employed the use of some getter and setter methods.

any other detail can be found within the commenting of the code.
